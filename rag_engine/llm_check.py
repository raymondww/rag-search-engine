                            - Common movie knowledge (famous actors, popular films)
                            - Genre conventions (horror = scary, animation = cartoon)
                            - Keep the rewritten query concise (under 10 words)

                            - Don't use boolean logic

                            Examples:
                            - "that bear movie where leo gets attacked" -> "The Revenant Leonardo DiCaprio bear attack"
                            - "movie about bear in london with marmalade" -> "Paddington London marmalade"
                            - "scary movie with bear from few years ago" -> "bear horror movie 2015-2020"
